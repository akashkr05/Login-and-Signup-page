# Login-and-Signup-page
This project for building a Login and Signup page using Python,
Tkinter, and SQL. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for user authentication
and registration, utilizing a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter, a Python library for 
creating desktop applications, and a backend database powered by SQL.
User Registration: The application allows new users to create an account by providing their desired username, password, and other required information. The user details are securely stored in an SQL database for future authentication.

User Login: Existing users can log in to the system by entering their username and password. The application verifies the credentials against the stored information in the SQL database and grants access upon successful authentication.

Password Encryption: The passwords entered by users are securely encrypted and stored in the SQL database, ensuring the confidentiality of user information.

User Interface: The graphical user interface is built using Tkinter, offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The login and signup forms are designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Error Handling: The application includes robust error handling mechanisms to provide informative feedback to users in case of incorrect credentials, account already exists, or any other potential errors during the login and signup process.

SQL Database Integration: The project integrates SQL (Structured Query Language) to create and manage the database that stores user information. It utilizes SQL queries for retrieving, storing, and updating user data.

Scalability: The codebase is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy customization and future enhancements. Additional features such as password recovery, profile management, or integration with other databases can be implemented to suit specific requirements.
